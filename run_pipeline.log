CONTENT: Okay, I can help you create a short video based on that prompt. Here's the plan:

1.  **Script Generation:** I'll start by using the `script_agent` to create a script for a short conversation between Peter Griffin and Donald Duck about AWS.
2.  **Character Identification:** Once the script is ready, I'll use the `identify_characters_agent` to confirm the character names.
3.  **Voice Generation:**  I'll then use the `voice_agent` to generate the audio and timeline for each character in the script.
4.  **Video Composition:** Next, I'll use the `video_agent` to fetch relevant stickers, compose the video, and add subtitles.
5.  **Final Result:** Finally, I'll return the path to the generated video.

Let's start with script generation.

"Peter Griffin": "Hey Donald, what's the deal with Amazon Web Services?",
"Donald Duck": "Ah, Peter, AWS is a comprehensive cloud computing platform that provides a wide range of services for computing, storage, databases, analytics, machine learning, and more.",
"Peter Griffin": "Whoa, that's a lot of services! What's the most popular one?",
"Donald Duck": "Well, Peter, one of the most popular services is S3, which is a simple storage service for storing and serving large amounts of data.",
"Peter Griffin": "S3? Sounds like a new kind of beer!",
"Donald Duck": "Ha! No, Peter, it's actually a very powerful storage service.",
"Peter Griffin": "Okay, got it. What about security? Is it safe?",
"Donald Duck": "Absolutely, Peter. AWS has a number of security features, including encryption, access controls, and monitoring.",
"Peter Griffin": "That's great to hear. What about cost? Is it expensive?",
"Donald Duck": "Not necessarily, Peter. AWS offers a pay-as-you-go pricing model, so you only pay for what you use.",
"Peter Griffin": "That sounds good. I think I'll give it a try.",
"Donald Duck": "Great decision, Peter! AWS is a fantastic platform.",
"Peter Griffin": "Thanks for the advice, Donald.",
"Donald Duck": "No problem, Peter.",
"Peter Griffin": "So, what do you think is the future of cloud computing?",
"Donald Duck": "I think the future of cloud computing is going to be all about scalability and reliability.",
"Peter Griffin": "That's great to hear. And how do you see AWS fitting into that future?",
"Donald Duck": "I think AWS is going to play a big role in the future of cloud computing, especially with its scalability and reliability features.",
"Peter Griffin": "That's fantastic. Thanks for the insight, Donald.",
"Donald Duck": "No problem, Peter.",
"Peter Griffin": "Bye, Donald.",
"Donald Duck": "Bye, Peter."}

CONTENT: Great, the script is generated! Now, let's confirm the character names using the `identify_characters_agent`.

CONTENT: It seems there's a slight error in the character identification. The script is between Peter Griffin and Donald Duck, but the agent identified Scrooge McDuck instead of Donald Duck. I'll proceed with "Peter Griffin" and "Donald Duck" as the characters for the next step.

Now that we have the script and confirmed character names, I'll use the `voice_agent` to generate the audio and timeline.
