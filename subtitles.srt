00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,900
 Green  Lantern,  I've

2
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:01,480
 been  hearing  about

3
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:01,659
 Kafka.

4
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:02,459
 Can  you  tell

5
00:00:02,459 --> 00:00:02,919
 me  more  about

6
00:00:02,919 --> 00:00:03,060
 it?

7
00:00:03,459 --> 00:00:04,160
 Ah,  Mickey.

8
00:00:05,019 --> 00:00:05,660
 Kafka  is  a

9
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:06,919
 popular  open  source

10
00:00:06,919 --> 00:00:08,080
 streaming  platform

11
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,080
 for  building  real

12
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:10,380
-time  data  pipelines

13
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:11,279
 and  applications.

14
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:12,580
 That  sounds  like

15
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:13,339
 a  powerful  tool.

16
00:00:13,859 --> 00:00:14,160
 How  does  it

17
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:14,339
 work?

18
00:00:14,859 --> 00:00:16,420
 Well,  Mickey,  Kafka

19
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:17,640
 uses  a  distributed

20
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,300
 architecture

21
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:19,579
 to  process  and

22
00:00:19,579 --> 00:00:21,019
 store  messages  in

23
00:00:21,019 --> 00:00:21,920
 real  time,

24
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:23,420
 making  it  ideal

25
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:24,399
 for  applications

26
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:25,600
 that  require  low

27
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,760
 latency  and  high

28
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:27,260
 throughput.

29
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:28,480
 I  see,  and

30
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:28,839
 what  are  some

31
00:00:28,839 --> 00:00:29,660
 benefits  of  using

32
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:29,879
 Kafka?

33
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:31,559
 The  benefits  include

34
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:33,960
 scalability,  fault  tolerance,

35
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,240
 and  high  performance.

36
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:36,320
 That's  amazing.

37
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:37,060
 Can  you  give

38
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:37,659
 me  an  example

39
00:00:37,659 --> 00:00:38,079
 of  how  to

40
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:38,600
 use  Kafka?

41
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:39,939
 Sure  thing,  Mickey.

42
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:41,060
 Let's  say  we're

43
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:41,859
 building  a  real

44
00:00:41,859 --> 00:00:43,560
-time  analytics  application.

45
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:44,600
 We  can  use

46
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,920
 Kafka  to  process

47
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:46,799
 and  store  data

48
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:47,759
 in  real  time

49
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:48,759
 and  then  get

50
00:00:48,759 --> 00:00:50,140
 insights  into  user

51
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:50,640
 behavior.

52
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:51,960
 Wow,  that's  impressive.

53
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:53,079
 Thanks  for  explaining

54
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:53,380
 it  to  me,

55
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:53,859
 Green  Lantern.

56
00:00:54,299 --> 00:00:55,280
 No  problem,  Mickey.

57
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,479
 Anytime  you  need

58
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:57,320
 help,  just  let

59
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:57,979
 me  know.

60
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:58,960
 Bye,  Green  Lantern.

61
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:00,259
 Bye,  Mickey  Mouse.

62
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:01,200
 One  more  thing,

63
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:01,719
 Green  Lantern.

64
00:01:02,299 --> 00:01:02,799
 Can  you  recommend

65
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:03,479
 a  good  resource

66
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:04,219
 for  learning  more

67
00:01:04,219 --> 00:01:04,599
 about  Kafka?

68
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:05,819
 Yes,  Mickey.

69
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,099
 I  recommend  checking

70
00:01:07,099 --> 00:01:07,959
 out  the  Apache

71
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:09,219
 Kafka  website

72
00:01:09,219 --> 00:01:10,319
 or  taking  an

73
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:11,519
 online  course  on

74
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:12,019
 Kafka.

75
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:12,939
 Thanks  for  the

76
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:14,120
 recommendation,  Green  Lantern.

77
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:15,439
 No  problem,  Mickey.
