1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,720
 Superman,  I've  been

2
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:01,379
 hearing  about  this

3
00:00:01,379 --> 00:00:02,700
 container  orchestration  tool

4
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:03,700
 called  Kubanetti's,

5
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:04,419
 and  I  wanted

6
00:00:04,419 --> 00:00:04,780
 to  get  your

7
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:05,400
 take  on  it.

8
00:00:05,599 --> 00:00:07,799
 Oh,  Elon,  Kubanetti's

9
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:08,460
 is  a  powerful

10
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:09,519
 tool  that  allows

11
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:11,199
 developers  to  automate

12
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:12,019
 the  deployment,

13
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:13,500
 scaling,  and  management

14
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,699
 of  containerized  applications.

15
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:17,219
 That's  impressive,  so

16
00:00:17,219 --> 00:00:17,899
 it's  like  a

17
00:00:17,899 --> 00:00:19,039
 superpower  for  developers.

18
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,000
 Ha,  well,  Elon,

19
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:22,440
 Kubanetti's  is  a

20
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,980
 powerful  tool,  but

21
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:25,160
 it's  not  necessarily

22
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,059
 a  superpower.

23
00:00:26,679 --> 00:00:27,300
 I  see,  so

24
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:27,760
 it's  like  a

25
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,699
 strong  tool,  but

26
00:00:28,699 --> 00:00:29,379
 not  invincible.

27
00:00:29,379 --> 00:00:32,679
 Exactly,  Elon.  Kubanetti's

28
00:00:32,679 --> 00:00:33,280
 is  a  strong

29
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,399
 tool,  but  it's

30
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:35,299
 not  invincible.

31
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:36,539
 It  has  its

32
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:38,060
 limitations  and  challenges.

33
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:39,060
 What  about  the

34
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:39,780
 benefits  of  using

35
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:40,420
 Kubanetti's?

36
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:42,880
 Well,  Elon,  Kubanetti's

37
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,299
 provides  several  benefits,

38
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:45,880
 including  automation,

39
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,479
 scalability,  and  high

40
00:00:47,479 --> 00:00:48,140
 availability.

41
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:49,640
 That's  fantastic.

42
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:50,359
 And  what  about

43
00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:51,100
 the  challenges  of

44
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:51,899
 using  Kubanetti's?

45
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,560
 Ah,  Elon,  one

46
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,079
 of  the  main

47
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:55,219
 challenges  is  that

48
00:00:55,219 --> 00:00:56,460
 Kubanetti's  can  be

49
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:57,920
 complex  and  difficult

50
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,679
 to  learn.

51
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:00,659
 Especially  for  beginners.

52
00:01:01,219 --> 00:01:01,780
 I  see,  so

53
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:02,299
 it's  like  a

54
00:01:02,299 --> 00:01:03,200
 tough  opponent,  but

55
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:03,859
 worth  the  fight?

56
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:05,959
 Ha,  exactly,  Elon.

57
00:01:06,939 --> 00:01:07,620
 Kubanetti's  is  a

58
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:08,760
 tough  opponent,  but

59
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,500
 it's  worth  the

60
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,799
 fight  for  experienced

61
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:11,459
 developers.

62
00:01:12,019 --> 00:01:12,760
 Thanks  for  explaining

63
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,099
 it  to  me,

64
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:13,439
 Superman.

65
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,180
 No  problem,  Elon.

66
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:16,319
 It's  always  great

67
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:17,099
 to  talk  tech

68
00:01:17,099 --> 00:01:17,840
 with  a  visionary

69
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,560
 like  you.

70
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:19,420
 So,  what  do

71
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:19,780
 you  think  is

72
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:20,359
 the  future  of

73
00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:21,260
 container  orchestration?

74
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:22,140
 I  think  the

75
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,159
 future  of  container

76
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:24,540
 orchestration  is  going

77
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:25,079
 to  be  all

78
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:26,359
 about  automation  and

79
00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:27,120
 self -healing.

80
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,140
 That's  incredible.

81
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:29,060
 And  how  do

82
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:29,939
 you  see  Kubanetti's

83
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:30,560
 fitting  into  that

84
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:30,900
 future?

85
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,420
 I  think  Kubanetti's

86
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:32,980
 is  going  to

87
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:33,680
 play  a  big

88
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,420
 role  in  the

89
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:35,420
 future  of  container

90
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:36,379
 orchestration,

91
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,840
 especially  with  its

92
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,239
 automation  and  self

93
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:40,140
-healing  features.

94
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,439
 That's  fantastic.

95
00:01:41,659 --> 00:01:42,079
 Thanks  for  the

96
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:42,719
 insight,  Superman.
